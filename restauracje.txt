1. A: take the shuttle Sitbusshuttle (€6 for 1 person), that goes directly next to the Vatican on Via Crescenzio, 2, walk for 10-15 minutes to Piazza Risorgimento, cross the square to the pharmacy, turn at left and continue for 1 minute until number 36, next to a glasses store and then buzz the interior 22, we are on 5th floor and we have the lift.?
2. From Fiumicino or Ciampino airport: take a shuttle to Termini Station, 4-6 euros/1 person, (40-50 minutes and you can buy tickets on line at: www.terravision.eu , with all the information), you arrive at Termini Station, take subway line A (€1,50/1 person), direction Battistini, after 6 stops, get off at Ottaviano, take the first exit to the left and go up the stairs, then turn left and take Via Ottaviano, walk for 5 minutes and turn left again, walk up to number 36, next to a glasses store and buzzy the interior 22, we are on 5th floor and we have the lift. ?
3. It's also easy if you take the direct train Fiumicino for station Termini (14-15 euro/1 person), then you take subway line A (1,50 euro/1 person) for 6 stops and you will arrive to Ottaviano, our B&B is very close to Ottaviano Subway station. ?
